# Testing Web Pages with Knockout.js

This is a small Katalon Studio project for demonstration purpose.
You can download the zip from [Releases]() page, unzip it, open it with your local Katalon Stduio.

I developed this project to propose a solution to a question raised in the Katalon User Forum:

- [Can't get value from field](https://forum.katalon.com/t/cant-get-value-from-field/51945)

This project was developed with Katalon Studio verion 7.9.1. The project should work on any versions newer than the 7.0.
